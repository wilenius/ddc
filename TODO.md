* ATM when recording game results, the code does not know whether it is a final match result (one-game match) or an interim score. There should be a way to "close" the score. Or perhaps it should be decided when creating a tournament (how many games)
* Implement multi-phase tournaments (e.g., round-robin + playoffs)
* Player account registration (linked to ranking list data?)
* Tournament-based rights management (only players + TD get to record scores)
* Separate tie-break logic for single-player tournaments (Kodiak formats esp. tricky since players have uneven amount of matches)
* Make notification messages look nicer
* Tournament (phase) resolution view: show results, see if tiebreaks are resolved, or if TD is needed to resolve
* Create a results report from a tournament
